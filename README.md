# Python Debugging Activity

This repository is used in the Ada Python Debugging Activity as an exercise for Ada students to practice using the Python debugger in VS Code.

To get set up first create a virtual environment.

`$ python3 -m venv venv`

Then activate the environment:

`$ source venv/bin/activate`

You can then install Pytest with:

`$ pip3 install pytest`

**Follow the Learn lessons for setting up VS Code for debugging**

## Running The Application

You can execute the application with: 

`$ python3 app.py`

It will crash, this is part of the exercise.  You can also run the tests with 

`$ pytest`
